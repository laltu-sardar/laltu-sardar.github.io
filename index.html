            <hr>
            
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Welcome to my webpage! I am currently an Assistant Professor at the <strong>School of Data Science, IISER Thiruvananthapuram</strong>.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
             I was a post-doctoral fellow at the Institute for Advancing Intelligence, TCG Centres for Research and Education in Science and Technology (<strong>TCG CREST</strong>), Kolkata, India. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the <strong>Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata</strong>, specializing in <strong>Searchable Encryption</strong>.
              During my doctoral studies, I worked under the guidance of <strong>Assoc. Prof. Sushmita Ruj</strong> and <strong>Prof. Bimal Kumar Roy</strong>, focusing on secure and efficient solutions in cloud computing, data privacy, and encrypted graph analytics â€” specifically <strong>Searchable Encryption</strong>. I conduct both theoretical research and applied work, including prototype implementations using real-world data.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Beyond research, I enjoy teaching and have conducted courses in <strong>Programming</strong>, <strong>Data Structures</strong>, and <strong>Algorithms</strong> for Ph.D. students. I am enthusiastic about <strong>C</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
            I do research in trending areas, focusing on improving data security and privacy using advanced cryptography.
            Besides searchable encryption, my current research interests include the foundations of <strong>blockchain</strong>, with a focus on Ethereum and its <strong>Layer-2</strong> technologies. My secondary interest lies in <strong>Post-quantum Cryptography</strong>.

    <h4>Education</h4>
    
    <p>
    I pursued my Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Computer Science from the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India, between 2016 and 2021. During this time, I was under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Sushmita Ruj and Prof. Bimal Kumar Roy.

Prior to my Ph.D., I completed my Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Computer Science at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India, from 2014 to 2016. I was supervised by Assoc. Prof. Sushmita Ruj during this period.

My academic journey started with a Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Pure Mathematics at Ballygunge Science College, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India, from 2012 to 2014. Prof. Avishek Adhikari supervised my studies during this time.

Before my master's degree, I pursued a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Mathematics at Charuchandra College, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India, from 2009 to 2012.

My secondary education in Science was completed at Kasba Chittaranjan High School, Kolkata, India, from 2007 to 2009.

I completed my secondary education at the same school in 2007.</p>
