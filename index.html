            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my webpage! Currently I am a Post-doctoral Research Fellow at the Institute of Advancing Intelligence, TCG CREST, Kolkata, India. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, where I specialized in Searchable Encryption.</p>

            <p>
During my doctoral studies, I had the privilege to work under the guidance of Assoc. Prof. Sushmita Ruj and Prof. Bimal Kumar Roy. My research focuses on developing efficient and secure solutions for various challenges in the domain of information security, particularly in cloud computing and data privacy, Secure Cloud Computing, Data Privacy, Encrypted Graph Analytics, Security, and Privacy in Blockchain technology</p>

            <p>

Apart from my academic pursuits, I have a keen interest in programming and have proficiency in languages such as C, Python, and Matlab. I have also worked on several academic projects, including Bitcoin transaction graph analysis and the application of coding theory in real-life scenarios.</p>

            <p>

In addition to my research and academic activities, I am actively involved in teaching and have conducted courses on topics such as Introduction to Programming and Data Structures and Design and Analysis of Combinatorial Algorithms for Ph.D. students in Computer Science.</p>

            <p>

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have received several awards and achievements, including qualifications in prestigious exams like GATE and JEST, as well as scholarships for academic excellence.</p>


            <p>In essence, my academic journey embodies a relentless pursuit of cryptographic innovation, where theoretical prowess converges with practical application to pave the way for enhanced data security in the digital age.</p>

    <h4>Education</h4>
    
    <p>
    I pursued my Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Computer Science from the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India, between 2016 and 2021. During this time, I was under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Sushmita Ruj and Prof. Bimal Kumar Roy.

Prior to my Ph.D., I completed my Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Computer Science at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India, from 2014 to 2016. I was supervised by Assoc. Prof. Sushmita Ruj during this period.

My academic journey started with a Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Pure Mathematics at Ballygunge Science College, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India, from 2012 to 2014. Prof. Avishek Adhikari supervised my studies during this time.

Before my master's degree, I pursued a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Mathematics at Charuchandra College, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India, from 2009 to 2012.

My secondary education in Science was completed at Kasba Chittaranjan High School, Kolkata, India, from 2007 to 2009.

I completed my secondary education at the same school in 2007.</p>
