Suppose you are allowed to perform only the operations provided in the instruction set given in the class.
Each load instruction lw can load a maximum of 32 bits.

Given two variables a and b, each 64 bits long, explain how you would add them using assembly language under these constraints.
You will finally store the value in c, i.e.,  c= a+b;

Write the assembly-level approach.
