1. Consider any rounding technique for binary numbers and give examples for each:
   a) Addition of floating-point numbers is not associative.
   b) Multiplication is not associative.
   
2. Complete all three approaches of the `print_bits` function, discussed in the class, which prints the bits of any given type of memory. Write a C program containing these functions. 
Print the memory representation for each data type: `int`, `long int`, `unsigned long int`, `short int`, `char`, `float`, `double`, `long double`, etc. If possible, do this for all such data types.
