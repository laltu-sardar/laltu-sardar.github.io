Guidelines for assignment 02:
1. In each assignment problem, take input from files only
2. Input file name for assignment problem with ID "AP0101" will be "input_AP0101.txt"
3. First line of the problem will be "no of tests", say k
4. Then there will be a k number of test cases.
5. Output the results in the terminal. We do not need test results checking in the input file.
6. For an array, it is mandatory to allocate memory dynamically using malloc/calloc. Free the memory after using.
7. Write the targeted problem in function:
8. Declaration of functions at the beginning is mandatory
9. Indentation should be proper.  
10. main function should only take input from files
11. We have uploaded a sample program and a sample input file for AP0101.
