        <strong>Secure Cloud Computing over Outsourced Encrypted Data</strong>
        <p>
            My primary research focus is on Secure Cloud Computing, particularly in the context of outsourcing encrypted data to third-party cloud service providers. I aim to develop cryptographic techniques and protocols to ensure data privacy and security in cloud environments.

        <strong>Blockchain Technology and Applications</strong>
        <p>
            I have a keen interest in exploring Blockchain Technology and its real-world applications, particularly in the context of enhancing the transparency and security of cloud services. I investigate the integration of blockchain with secure cloud computing to enhance trust and accountability in cloud environments.
        </p>

        <strong>Post-Quantum Cryptography, especially Lattice-Based Cryptography</strong>
        <p>
            With the advent of quantum computing, I am actively exploring Post-Quantum Cryptography, focusing on lattice-based cryptographic techniques. Lattice-based cryptography offers promising solutions for achieving security against quantum attacks, and I explore their applications in various cryptographic protocols.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Quantum Cryptography</strong> 
        <p> I am eager to explore the field of Quantum Cryptography, which leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to develop cryptographic protocols that provide provable security. My research interests include Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), quantum-secure communication protocols, and their integration into existing and emerging secure systems to enhance resilience against both classical and quantum attacks. </p> </li>
