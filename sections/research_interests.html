        <li>
        <strong>Secure Cloud Computing over Outsourced Encrypted Data</strong>
        <p>
            My primary research focus is on Secure Cloud Computing, particularly in the context of outsourcing encrypted data to third-party cloud service providers. I aim to develop cryptographic techniques and protocols to ensure data privacy and security in cloud environments.
        </p>

        <strong>Blockchain Technology and Applications</strong>
        <p>
            I have a keen interest in exploring Blockchain Technology and its real-world applications, particularly in the context of enhancing the transparency and security of cloud services. I investigate the integration of blockchain with secure cloud computing to enhance trust and accountability in cloud environments.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Post-Quantum Cryptography, especially Lattice-Based Cryptography</strong>
        <p>
            With the advent of quantum computing, I am actively exploring Post-Quantum Cryptography, focusing on lattice-based cryptographic techniques. Lattice-based cryptography offers promising solutions for achieving security against quantum attacks, and I explore their applications in various cryptographic protocols.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Private Information Retrieval (PIR)</strong>
        <p>
            I am interested in the field of Private Information Retrieval, which focuses on retrieving information from a database without revealing the queries or the retrieved information to the database owner or any other party. I explore various techniques to achieve efficient and secure PIR solutions.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Multi-party Computation (MPC)</strong>
        <p>
            Multi-party Computation is another area of my research interest, which involves multiple parties jointly computing a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. I investigate MPC protocols to enable secure collaboration among multiple parties in various applications.
